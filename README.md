# TriviaApp

A simple trivia app built with React Native, TypeScript, Jotai for state management, and Reanimated for animations. This project fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia DB API and presents them to the user. It supports both iOS and Android platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: A framework for building native apps using React.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types.
- **Jotai**: A state management library for React.
- **Reanimated**: A library for creating smooth animations in React Native.
- **Expo**: A framework and platform for universal React applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of modern React Native development practices, including:

Using TypeScript for type safety.
Managing state with Jotai, a lightweight state management library.
Creating animations with Reanimated.
Structuring a React Native project for maintainability and scalability.
Fetching and displaying data from a remote API.
This project serves as a learning tool and a template for building more complex React Native applications.
